In order to run the cluster.py example included in this download, you will need
to get the PPDB data for this directory.

If you are on Linux, just run the enclosed script:

./get_ppdb_data.sh

If that doesn't work, manually download the data from:

http://seas.upenn.edu/~acocos/data/paraphrase_clustering_ppdb_data.tar.gz

and unzip the three files to this directory (<PATH>/cluster_paraphrases/data/ppdb_data/).
The contents will be:

GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.p
pp_samestems_xxl_Independent.p
pp_samestems_xxl_PPDB2.0Score.p
